GJGolgi_ReducedMorph
====================

Reduced morphology model of a cerebellar Golgi cell

This model has been built in neuroConstruct with data from Vervaeke et
al 2012, starting from a morphologically detailed model which was in
turn based upon Solinas et al 2007. It readonably reproduces dendritic
current attenuation and allows realistic gap junction placement, while
being composed of only 10 compartments.
